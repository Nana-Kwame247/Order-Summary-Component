## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learnt I need to practice a lot after watching tutorials because the learning is better seen in my practise of building projects.

I learnt how to use some basic html tags like <span></span> and <br> to add clearity to my page.

Code I am proud of:

```html
<p class="summary">
  You can now listen to millions of songs,<br />
  audiobooks, and podcasts on any device <br />anywhere you like!
</p>
```

I am proud of the above because for a while I wanted to use margin and padding to get the element to move to the next line and the like.

```css
body {
  background-image: url("/CSS/images/pattern-background-desktop.svg");
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  font-size: 16px;
  font-family: "Red Hat Display", sans-serif;
  background-color: hsl(225, 100%, 98%);
}
```

### Continued development

I plan to focus on practise more with flexbox and grid and customized css.

### Useful resources

- [ Resource 1](https://www.frontendmasters.com/bootcamp/) - This helped me in cementing most of what I had already learnt with regards to HTML and CSS from other tutorials and how to use them in practise.
- [ Resource 2](https://www.w3schools.com) - This is an amazing site which gives practical code snippets that you can modify to help you solve the challnege at hand.
